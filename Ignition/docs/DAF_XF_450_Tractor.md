The vehicle is configured to have car steering (i.e. different wheel angles for inner and outer front wheels) and differential drive on the rear wheels. This requires a Lua script to control the servo mix for ArduPilot which is supplied in the scripts sub-directory.   

## Usage

**Run Gazebo**

```bash
$ ign gazebo -v4 -s -r daf_truck_runway.sdf
```
**Run ArduPilot SITL**

Copy the script `daf_xf_450_tractor_mixer.lua` to the SITL scripts directory, then start SITL:

```bash
sim_vehicle.py -v Rover -f JSON --add-param-file=$HOME/SITL_Models/Ignition/config/daf_xf_450_tractor.param --console --map
```

You may need to reboot the autopilot to ensure the additional scripting parameters are loaded.
