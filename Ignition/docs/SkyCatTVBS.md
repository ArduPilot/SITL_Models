# SkyCat TVBS QuadPlane

A model for a SkyCat TVBS QuadPlane. It is derived from the [RF version in SITL_Models]( https://github.com/ArduPilot/SITL_Models/tree/master/RealFlight/Released_Models/QuadPlanes/Tailsitters/SkyCat_TVBS)

## Usage

Ignition and the plugins should be installed as per the [ardupilot_gazebo wiki instructions](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot_gazebo/wiki).

Update the `IGN_GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH` to include these models:

```bash
export IGN_GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH=$IGN_GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH:\
$HOME/SITL_Models/Ignition/models:\
$HOME/SITL_Models/Ignition/worlds
```

#### Run Gazebo

```bash
$ ign gazebo -v4 -r skycat_runway.sdf
```

#### Run ArduPilot SITL

```bash
$ sim_vehicle.py -v ArduPlane -f JSON --add-param-file=$HOME/SITL_Models/Ignition/config/skycat_tvbs.param --console --map
```

### Testing

The tailsitter has a basic tune so that it is operational, but it could be much improved. The aerodynamics model (the lift-drag system plugin) does not account for prop-wash or similar effects, so the simulation is illustrative rather than realistic.
