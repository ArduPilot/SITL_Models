# Skywalker X8 QuadPlane

Models for the Skywalker X8 in plane and quad-plane configurations for use with ArduPilot.

## Usage

Ignition and the plugins should be installed as per the [ardupilot_gazebo wiki instructions](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot_gazebo/wiki).

Update the `IGN_GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH` to include these models:

```bash
export IGN_GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH=$IGN_GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH:\
$HOME/SITL_Models/Ignition/models:\
$HOME/SITL_Models/Ignition/worlds
```

### `skywalker_x8`

An X8 configured as a delta-wing plane.

#### Run Gazebo

```bash
$ ign gazebo -v4 -r skywalker_x8_runway.sdf
```

#### Run ArduPilot SITL

```bash
$ sim_vehicle.py -v ArduPlane -f JSON --add-param-file=$HOME/SITL_Models/Ignition/config/skywalker_x8.param --console --map
```

### `skywalker_x8_quad`

An X8 configured as a delta-wing quad plane.

#### Run Gazebo

```bash
$ ign gazebo -v4 -r skywalker_x8_quad_runway.sdf
```

#### Run ArduPilot SITL

```bash
$ sim_vehicle.py -v ArduPlane -f JSON --add-param-file=$HOME/SITL_Models/Ignition/config/skywalker_x8_quad.param --console --map
```

### Notes

- The plane / quad-plane parameters have been [auto-tuned](https://ardupilot.org/plane/docs/automatic-tuning-with-autotune.html) for regular flight. The Q-modes are using default parameters.
- The quad plane has been set up as an H-frame as the original configuration as an X-frame had such poor yaw authority the vehicle could not be controlled when transitioning from FBWA flight back to Q modes.
- Additional yaw authority is provided by rotating the VTOL motors 3 degrees towards the centreline.
